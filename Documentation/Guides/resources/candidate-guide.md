# Welcome to Sono-Eval! 👋

**A Guide for Candidates**

Welcome! If you're here, you're likely about to complete an assessment using Sono-Eval. This guide will help you understand what to expect and how to get the most value from your experience.

---

## 🤔 What is This?

Sono-Eval is **not** a traditional pass/fail test. Instead, it's a **learning and growth tool** designed to:

- Help you understand your current skills
- Identify your natural strengths
- Show you specific areas to improve
- Track your progress over time
- Provide actionable, helpful feedback

Think of it as having a knowledgeable mentor review your work and provide detailed, constructive feedback.

## 🎯 What Makes Sono-Eval Different?

###  Traditional Tests vs. Sono-Eval

| Traditional Tests | Sono-Eval |
|---|---|
| Pass/Fail result | Detailed feedback on multiple dimensions |
| One overall score | Scores for technical, design, collaboration, etc. |
| Little to no explanation | Every score explained with evidence |
| Focus on "right answer" | Focus on your approach and thinking |
| Stressful experience | Learning opportunity |

---

## 🛤️ What Are "Assessment Paths"?

Sono-Eval evaluates you across multiple dimensions, called "paths":

### 🔧 Technical Path
- Code quality and structure
- Problem-solving approach
- Algorithm efficiency
- Testing practices

### 🎨 Design Path
- Architecture decisions
- Design patterns
- System thinking
- Modularity and organization

### 🤝 Collaboration Path
- Code readability
- Documentation quality
- Communication clarity
- Team-oriented thinking

### 🧠 Problem-Solving Path
- Your approach to the challenge
- How you break down problems
- Creative thinking
- Edge case consideration

### 💬 Communication Path
- How well you explain your thinking
- Comments and documentation
- Clarity of intent
- README or explanation quality

**Each path is evaluated independently**, so you can be strong in some areas while developing in others—and that's perfectly okay!

## 📊 Understanding Your Scores

### Score Ranges

- **80-100**: Excellent - You're demonstrating strong skills in this area
- **60-79**: Good - You're on the right track with room to grow
- **40-59**: Developing - You're building skills; focus on the recommendations
- **0-39**: Learning - This is an area where focused study will help most

### Important: Scores Are Just One Part

Your score tells you **where you are**, but the real value is in:
- **Evidence** - Specific examples from your code
- **Strengths** - What you did well (do more of this!)
- **Recommendations** - Exactly what to improve
- **Micro-Motives** - What naturally energizes you

---

## 🎯 What Are "Micro-Motives"?

Based on the "Dark Horse" model, micro-motives are your intrinsic motivations:

- **Mastery** - You love deeply understanding things
- **Exploration** - You enjoy trying new approaches
- **Collaboration** - You value teamwork
- **Innovation** - You seek creative solutions
- **Quality** - You care about craftsmanship

Understanding your micro-motives helps you:
- Find work that energizes you
- Play to your natural strengths
- Develop in ways that feel authentic

**There are no "good" or "bad" motives** - they're just insights into what drives you!

---

## 🚀 How to Approach the Assessment

### Before You Start

1. **Set up Sono-Eval** - See [First-Time Setup Guide](first-time-setup.md) if you're installing on your personal machine
2. **Read the instructions carefully** - Make sure you understand what's being asked
3. **Check the time limit** - Plan accordingly
4. **Enable Guided Mode** - If this is your first assessment, use guided mode for helpful tips
5. **Take a deep breath** - This is a learning opportunity, not life-or-death

### While Working

1. **Think out loud** - Write comments explaining your reasoning
2. **Show your work** - Include tests, documentation, README
3. **Don't over-think** - There's rarely one "perfect" solution
4. **Ask questions** - If allowed, clarify requirements
5. **Manage your time** - Better to submit something complete than perfect but unfinished

### What to Include

✅ **DO Include**:
- Working code that solves the problem
- Tests (even basic ones)
- A README explaining your approach
- Comments where logic might be unclear
- Considerations of edge cases
- Your thought process

❌ **DON'T Worry About**:
- Making it "perfect"
- Using the most advanced techniques
- Trying to impress with complexity
- Hiding areas where you're unsure

**Authenticity is valuable!** Show how you actually think and work.

## 📖 Reading Your Results

After your assessment, you'll receive detailed feedback. Here's how to read it:

### 1. Overall Score
A quick summary, but **don't focus only on this number!**

### 2. Path Scores
See how you did in each dimension (Technical, Design, Collaboration, etc.)

### 3. Evidence
**This is key!** Specific examples from your code showing what you did well or could improve.

Example:
> "Code Quality (85/100): Your function naming is clear and follows Python conventions (lines 15-30). Consider adding type hints for better maintainability."

### 4. Strengths
What you did well. **This is just as important as areas for improvement!**

### 5. Areas for Improvement
Specific, actionable suggestions. Not "you're bad at X" but "here's how to improve X."

### 6. Recommendations
Concrete next steps for your development.

### 7. Micro-Motives
Insights into what drives you. Use this for self-understanding.

## 💡 Making the Most of Your Feedback

### Immediately After

1. **Read everything carefully** - Don't just look at the score
2. **Note your strengths** - Understand what you're good at
3. **Identify patterns** - Are there themes in the feedback?
4. **Ask questions** - If anything is unclear

### In the Following Days

1. **Pick ONE area to focus on** - Don't try to fix everything at once
2. **Find resources** - Use the learning resources we provide
3. **Practice deliberately** - Work on that specific skill
4. **Track your progress** - Notice as you improve

### If You're Invited to Resubmit

1. **Address the feedback** - Show you can learn and iterate
2. **Don't change everything** - Keep what worked well
3. **Explain your changes** - Show your thinking
4. **Ask for clarity** - If you're unsure what to improve

## ❓ Common Questions

### "What if my score is low?"

**Low scores are learning opportunities!** Everyone starts somewhere, and growth is what matters.  The system gives you specific guidance on what to improve. Use it!

### "Can I retry?"

Usually, yes! Ask your evaluator. Each attempt gives you fresh, detailed feedback.

### "Is this judging me as a person?"

No! This is evaluating specific skills at a specific moment in time. Your worth isn't defined by a coding assessment.

### "What if I disagree with the feedback?"

That's okay! The system isn't perfect. Talk to your evaluator about specific points. Sometimes there's context the system missed.

### "How long will this take?"

- **System processing**: Usually 5-30 seconds
- **Your time**: Depends on the challenge (typically 30 minutes to 3 hours)

### "What if I don't finish in time?"

Submit what you have! Partial credit with good thinking beats nothing. The system evaluates what you've done.

## 🌱 Growth Mindset

### Remember:

- **Skills are learnable** - You can improve anything with practice
- **Mistakes are data** - They show you where to focus
- **Progress matters** - Not perfection
- **Everyone's path is different** - Don't compare yourself to others
- **This is one snapshot** - It doesn't define you

### Your Journey:

```
Where You Are → Where You're Going → How to Get There
  (Current      (Goals &           (Actionable
   Scores)       Strengths)          Feedback)
```

Sono-Eval helps with all three!
