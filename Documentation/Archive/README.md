## Current Versions

For current, active documentation, see:

- **[Start Here](../START_HERE.md)** - Landing page for new users

## Why Archive?

Following the "Less but Better" principle, we archive rather than delete to:

- Preserve historical context
- Maintain reference for future work
- Keep main documentation focused on current, actionable content
- Reduce cognitive load for users

## When to Archive

Archive documentation when:

- It's superseded by newer, consolidated versions
- It's no longer needed as a primary entry point
- It's internal/engineering-focused rather than user-facing
- It's a one-off fix or implementation plan that's been completed
