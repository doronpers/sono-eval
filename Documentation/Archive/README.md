# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical and internal documentation that has been superseded or is no longer needed as primary entry points.

## What's Archived

### Reports-Historical/

Contains internal reports, implementation plans, and fix notes that were created during development but are no longer needed for day-to-day use:

- **Implementation Plans** (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`) - Detailed implementation plans for specific features
- **Fix Notes** (`FIX_*.md`) - One-off troubleshooting and fix documentation
- **Navigation Reviews** (`REVIEW_NAVIGATION.md`) - Navigation structure review documents

## Current Versions

For current, active documentation, see:

- **[Current Reports](../Reports/README.md)** - Active reports and audits
- **[Documentation Hub](../README.md)** - Main documentation index
- **[Start Here](../START_HERE.md)** - Landing page for new users

## Why Archive?

Following the "Less but Better" principle, we archive rather than delete to:

- Preserve historical context
- Maintain reference for future work
- Keep main documentation focused on current, actionable content
- Reduce cognitive load for users

## When to Archive

Archive documentation when:

- It's superseded by newer, consolidated versions
- It's no longer needed as a primary entry point
- It's internal/engineering-focused rather than user-facing
- It's a one-off fix or implementation plan that's been completed
