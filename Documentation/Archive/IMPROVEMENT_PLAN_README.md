# Archived: IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md

**Archived Date**: January 21, 2026
**Reason**: Redundant with ROADMAP.md and Documentation/Governance/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md

## What This Document Contains

`IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` was a comprehensive 1945-line planning document created to guide
major UX and feature enhancements. It contains:

1. **Mobile Companion Experience** - Detailed implementation instructions for enhancing
   the mobile interface with progressive disclosure, guided workflows, and rich interactions

2. **Results Visualization & Dashboard** - Comprehensive plan for visualizing assessment
   results using Chart.js with radar charts, progress rings, and trend analysis

3. **CLI Developer Experience** - Detailed instructions for improving the command-line
   interface with Rich formatting, interactive modes, and guided workflows

## Why It Was Archived

- **Redundancy**: Significant overlap with ROADMAP.md (high-level priorities) and
  Documentation/Governance/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md (detailed implementation guides)

- **Scope**: The document described future aspirational features rather than current
  documentation, making it more appropriate for planning documents than root-level files

- **Maintenance**: Having multiple sources of truth for roadmap items creates
  confusion and maintenance burden

## Where to Find This Information Now

- **High-level priorities**: See [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)
- **Detailed implementation guides**: See [Documentation/Governance/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md](../Governance/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md)
- **Current features**: See [Documentation/README.md](../README.md) and feature-specific guides

## Preserving Value

The detailed implementation instructions in this document remain valuable for:

- Future development work on mobile UX
- Visualization implementation guidance
- CLI enhancement specifications

These specifications should be:
1. Referenced during feature implementation
2. Updated as features are completed
3. Eventually deprecated when features are documented in user-facing docs

**Note**: This archived document is preserved for historical reference and detailed
specifications. For current development priorities, always refer to ROADMAP.md.
